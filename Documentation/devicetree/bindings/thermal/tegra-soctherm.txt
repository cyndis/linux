Tegra124 SOCTHERM thermal management system

Required properties :
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm".
- reg : Should contain 1 entry:
  - SOCTHERM register set
- interrupts : Defines the interrupt used by SOCTHERM
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - tsensor
  - soctherm
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - soctherm
- #thermal-sensor-cells : For thermctl sensors. Should be 1.

Example :

	soctherm@0,700e2000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm";
		reg = <0x0 0x700e2000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_TSENSOR>,
			<&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_SOC_THERM>;
		clock-names = "tsensor", "soctherm";
		resets = <&tegra_car 78>;
		reset-names = "soctherm";

		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};
