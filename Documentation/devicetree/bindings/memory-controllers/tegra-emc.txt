Tegra124 SoC EMC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-emc".
- reg : Should contain 1 or 2 entries:
  - EMC register set
  - MC register set : Required only if no node with
    'compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-mc"' exists. The MC register set
    is first read from the MC node. If it doesn't exist, it is read
    from this property.
- timings : Should contain 1 entry for each supported clock rate.
  Entries should be named "timing@n" where n is a 0-based increasing
  number. The timings must be listed in rate-ascending order.

Required properties for timings :
- clock-frequency : Should contain the memory clock rate.
- nvidia,parent-clock-frequency : Should contain the rate of the EMC
  clock's parent clock.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  - emc-parent : EMC's parent clock.
- The following properties contain EMC timing characterization values:
  - nvidia,emc-zcal-cnt-long
  - nvidia,emc-auto-cal-interval
  - nvidia,emc-ctt-term-ctrl
  - nvidia,emc-cfg
  - nvidia,emc-cfg-2
  - nvidia,emc-sel-dpd-ctrl
  - nvidia,emc-cfg-dig-dll
  - nvidia,emc-bgbias-ctl0
  - nvidia,emc-auto-cal-config
  - nvidia,emc-auto-cal-config2
  - nvidia,emc-auto-cal-config3
  - nvidia,emc-mode-reset
  - nvidia,emc-mode-1
  - nvidia,emc-mode-2
  - nvidia,emc-mode-4
- nvidia,emc-burst-data : EMC timing characterization data written to
                          EMC registers.
- nvidia,mc-burst-data : EMC timing characterization data written to
                         MC registers.
